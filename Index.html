Second: is to place all research into a research paper that consists of why it is being researched, and how the research can be implemented. Lastly: is to finally implement said research to communities that is inside the scope of what is researched.

The research is important for those who have little to no knowledge of the implications what volcanic eruptions can do and what dangers it can bring to a community, it will be conducted by looking for different sources in the internet on how to effectively safeguard a community when a volcanic eruption occurs, second is to interview local government officials in the target community such as Barangay Captains.

                                Volcanic eruptions are initiated by the movement of heat beneath the Earth's surface. These eruptions typically commence with the accumulation of gas-rich molten rock (magma) in reservoirs near the surface and may be preceded by the release of steam and gas from small ground vents. Moreover, minor earthquakes, often resulting from the interaction between dense, slow-moving magma and more permeable magma, can act as precursors to volcanic eruptions, especially those of an explosive nature.

                            <p class="para">
                                Furthermore, volcanic eruptions can give rise to secondary events such as floods, landslides, and mudslides when coupled with precipitation. Additionally, they can incite wildfires through the emission of hot ashes. Beyond these immediate effects, volcanic eruptions also play a role in climate change by emitting gases such as sulfur dioxide, capable of inducing global cooling, and volcanic carbon dioxide, with the potential to contribute to global warming.

                        There are typically 40-50 continuing eruptions, and out of those generally around 20 will be actively erupting on any particular day. Overall, 50 volcanoes were in continuing eruption status as of 17 August 2023. An eruption marked as "continuing" does not always mean persistent daily activity but indicates at least intermittent eruptive events without a break of 3 months or more. As of August 2, 2023, the latest eruption listed in the list of the Global Volcanism Program is Poas, Costa Rica.

                    One must be aware of what to do prior to, during, and after a volcanic eruption in order to ensure their own survival. Researchers advise people to gather the required resources, such as food and clothing for the upcoming days, and to make sure to retain all of their vital papers before the volcanic explosion. Additionally, work on communicating with everyone in the neighbourhood. Keep yourself safe and pay attention to the volcanic eruption alerts while the activity is taking place. If the authorities urge you to leave even though it appears safe to you to stay, heed their advice because they are aware of the potential damage a volcanic eruption might do.
                </p>

                <p class="para">
                    Wearing protective clothing is another way to shield yourself from the falling ash, which can irritate or harm your skin. Additionally, carry a mask which protects your respiratory system because it will be risky for your breathing. After the volcanic eruption, pay attention to the authorities when they say whether it is safe to exit the evacuation center. Protect yourself from falling ash by wearing your mask at all times. 
                </p>

                <p class="para" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">
                    When the authorities declare it is safe to return home following volcanic activity, check your neighbourhood to see if there has been any damage, then ask for advice on whether it is safe to stay there. For up-to-date updates on the volcano, keep listening to the news. Ashfalls are heavy on roofs and may be the reason for a roof's collapse, therefore if it is safe to go outdoors, be careful to clean your roof while it still has ash on it.
